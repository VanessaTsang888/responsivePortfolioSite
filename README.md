# My Responsive Portfolio Website

I have made a good start in developing my own portfolio website that will be responsive. This is one of my personal projects that I have been working on around my day job within UI Development on various government project. Please note that due to the industry of my commercial work (government projects) most are forbidden from being published on the public domain. Therefore, I am only able to publish my personal projects and any software applications I have developed from my online training courses. However, in the near future, I will be able to show case one of my commerical project which is a public facing and dynamic portal application that allows users to apply for a government grant online reducing most of the paperwork and reducing climate change. On this project, I used React.js to write reusable Components, and Redux to manage the states and to write and store dummy data. Used Jest Snapshot testing (a Javascript testing library) to test my Components (with the React testing library).

## About

For this project written **HTML5**, CSS2/3 and JavaScript code to develop this website application. This website also uses Bootstrap which is a popular frontend libary that makes writing CSS easier and makes my website responsive which is important for user experience today.

When I have completed this protfolio website, it will have multiple pages such as the Work Experiences and Contact Me pages. The protfolio section will be filterable to improve the user experience.

### The Purpose

However, I am looking to develop a brand new responsive using React.js and TypeScript for type safety in the near future.
