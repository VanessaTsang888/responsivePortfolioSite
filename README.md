For this project written **HTML5**, CSS2/3 and JavaScript code to develop this website application. This website also uses Bootstrap which is a popular frontend libary that makes writing CSS easier and makes my website responsive which is important for user experience today.

When I have completed this protfolio website, it will have multiple pages such as the Work Experiences and Contact Me pages. The protfolio section will be filterable to improve the user experience.

The purpose of developing my own portfolio website is to upskill on various frontend development languages and framework. Also to showcase my UI development, website development skills.
However, I am looking to develop a brand new responsive using React.js and TypeScript for type safety in the near future.
